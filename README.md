# Sudoku Solver


# Intentions: 

Talk briefly about the game of Sudoku and how we were interested in a solver.  
Introduce Backtracking Algorithm and Simulated Annealing algorithms and how we are  
going to compare them with experiments as well as building a GUI visualizer for each  

# Overview

Briefly talk about each file and their uses (game.py, driver.py, backtracking.py, etc...)  
**Mention Imports (pygame, matplotlib, etc...)**


# Our Tests

Describe each of the tests that we performed and what kind of results we were expecting  
Also describe what the generator does

# How to Run the Testing Experiments

Step by step process on how to run experiments  
Explain more in-depth about testing.py

# Experiment Results

Pictures of our graphs  
Short sentence about what each graph shows and what we learned and if it was what we were predicting  

# How to Run GUI Simulation

Step by step of how to run GUI and the tweakable settings
