# Sudoku Solver


# Intentions: 

Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle game. Given a 9x9 grid, the objective is to fill the grid with digits so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids or "squares" contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. For our project, we were particularly interested in the idea of how a computer would solve this game.  

Using the two most common algorithms for solving Sudoku, backtracking and simulated annealing, we ran a number of experiments on both to test performance, efficiency, as well as how they would scale with board sizes other than 9x9.  

Additionally, we also developed a simiple visualizer GUI to simulate the solving process of each algorithm.

# Overview

Briefly talk about each file and their uses (game.py, driver.py, backtracking.py, etc...)  
**Mention Imports (pygame, matplotlib, etc...)**


# Our Tests

Describe each of the tests that we performed and what kind of results we were expecting  
Also describe what the generator does

# How to Run the Testing Experiments

Step by step process on how to run experiments  
Explain more in-depth about testing.py

# Experiment Results
