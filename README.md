# Sudoku Solver


# Intentions: 

Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle game. Given a 9x9 grid, the objective is to fill the grid with digits so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3Ã—3 subgrids or "squares" contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. For our project, we were particularly interested in the idea of how a computer would solve this game.  

Using the two most common algorithms for solving Sudoku, backtracking and simulated annealing, we implemented both and ran a number of experiments to test performance, efficiency, and how they would scale with board sizes other than 9x9.  

Additionally, we also developed a simiple visualizer GUI to simulate the solving process of each algorithm.

# Overview

Our project can be split up into two components, the testing experiments and the GUI. ```backtracking.py``` and ```simulatedannealing.py``` contain the implementation of the corresponding algorithm. ```utilities.py``` contains helper functions used throughout other files such as generating random Sudoku boards or printing matrices in the terminal. ```testing.py``` is where all the experiments and data collections were performed. ```game.py``` contains the GUI implementation and ```driver.py``` starts the game.  

A ```requirements.txt``` is provided for required import installations. You can also manually install the libraries yourself since there are only three: matplotlib, numpy, and pygame.
